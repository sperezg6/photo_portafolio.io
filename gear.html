            <h2>Canon FTb QL</h3>
            <p>The Canon FTb QL with a 50 mm lens is a classic 35mm single-lens reflex (SLR) camera, renowned for its robustness and quality. Introduced in the early 1970s, it's a manual focus camera with a mechanically-timed focal-plane shutter. Key features include:</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Design and Build: The camera has a solid, durable metal body. It's relatively heavy and sturdy, characteristic of the cameras from that era.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Lens: It typically comes with a 50mm lens, which is versatile for a wide range of photography styles. The lens is known for its sharpness and clarity.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>    
                Quick Loading (QL) System: The "QL" in its name stands for "Quick Loading," which refers to a special mechanism that makes loading film easier and faster compared to other cameras of its time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Shutter and Exposure: The FTb QL offers a range of shutter speeds, from 1 second to 1/1000th of a second, and a bulb mode for long exposures. It has a through-the-lens (TTL) metering system for exposure control, which requires a battery.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Viewfinder: The viewfinder is bright and includes a microprism focusing aid, which helps in achieving sharp focus manually.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Compatibility: This camera uses the Canon FD lens mount, making it compatible with a wide range of FD lenses. I'm currently using a 50 mm lens.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Durability: Known for its reliability and durability, it's a popular choice among vintage camera enthusiasts..</p>
